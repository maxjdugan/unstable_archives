<p>This website is the culmination of several years of work to discover, document, and digitize the archival remnants of Elizabeth Sharaf un-Nisa Ducarel. This website is meant to accompany the American Historical Review Article entitled <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/128/1/144/7098190">“Becoming Elizabeth”</a>.A podcast about that article is available for a listen <a href="https://www.historians.org/becoming-elizabeth-plus-aha-2023">at this link</a>. In addition, this website reflects on the ethical issue surrounding the digitization of women’s archival remnants and the documentation of family archives related to South Asian history.</p>
