Iron and cut steel were also especially popular during this period. The advent of the rolling mill, or a machine which passes through metal stock to create uniform thickness and structure, in the mid 18th century made the production of gold and silver jewelry more streamlined. As were most Georgian and Regency-era jewelry, this pendant has a closed back to foil or place a thin sheet of metal behind the gems to reflect more light. Carnelian and ruby are two reddish types of gemstones commonly featured in daytime jewelry and share similar physical characteristics.",

The salary from that time up to the time of writing this letter is due, and the amount for the two months, which is 3300 rupees has not reached the aforesaid brother in this state of affairs, the aforementioned brother is passing his days in intense suffering. There is no one [to help] but the lord according to this petition about this matter, whatever order.</p>\n<p>The second thing is the amount of two thousand rupees for buying one  haveli  is  placed in the trust of Mr X and the receipt  For that aforementioned amount by English handwriting is with Raja Devi Singh Bahadur. The aforementioned Mr. Sahab never gave the aforementioned money to this servant.  It would be the very picture of the lord’s guardianship if  the lord through his great generosity could write to obtain the receipt for the above-mentioned amount  from the Raja Bahadur Sahib and have it sent to the aforementioned Mr. Sahab  and  at this time of difficulty and vexation,  if the extent/number of the written amount [on the receipt]  were sought from the Mr. Sahab, and entrust it to the servant.  And it was necessary that this be brought forward. </p>\n<p>The third is that it is very well known that the Lord of Blessing/Favor/Benefit, Mr. Qutb al-Daw'lah Bahādur, at the time of [their] return to the homeland, had dispensed/expended [shown] some care and compassion toward  Ducarel kindly provided this servant with a letter, in his own handwriting, addressed to the Raja of Burdwan, expressing the following: in light of of these graces, it is necessary for him [the rajah of Burdwan] to show this type of regard: to give the amount of 100 rupees per month to Alim Beg,  meaning have the Raja arrange to be given a whole sum of 1,200 rupees per year. Oh lord, the Rajah Devi Singh and also the <span style='color:red'><u>illegible</u></span> Lawyer are well aware of this matter but until now, the Rajah of Burdwan has not given the specified monthly amount to the servant [me]. The lord [Ducarel] is the master of the servant’s [my] health and wealth, and is his guardian. If he [Ducarel] in these matters, too, acts as a guardian, it is certain that justice will prevail. I have communicated everything for your information. Whatever order.</p>\n<p>The fourth is this: the state(s) of the servant [me] has become that of extreme worry , and his [my] situation has reached poverty and  deprivation, and where he [I] has [have] dependents, too  In this way also, he is not getting even one penny (kharmuhra). The situation in Calcutta is clear to the gentleman of high stature, and  the sum of one thousand and one hundred rupees is owed to the  money lenders.  [If] in such a way the details of the account of this money could be passed on to Janab-i Vala for his consideration/inspection. The current state of the debt is outstanding, the above-mentioned amounts have become dangerous, on top of this, the money lenders’ requests [for their money] have increased [to a new high degree], and in all respects—the essential expenses, distress and worry—the servant is in the hands of Janab-i Vala [that great man] without the support and kind regards of that Lord [Ducarel], [this servant] cannot find a way out of [escape from] being indebted to the moneylenders and paying [off] the remainder. It is hoped that the piece of the letter  be ordered to be addressed to the Sahib in/of district Purnea or Burdwan in his own handwriting so that bread can reach the lips (we can eat). We are occupied praying for the prosperity of that lord.</p>\n<p>The fifth [thing] is the  lands of the canal [‘bandhe’] of Khwajah Anwar Shahid   which is a part of  Burdwan.  The beneficent lord [Ducarel]  agreed to fix/confirm the administration <sup>1</sup> for the rent/taxes of these lands by the agents/tax gatherers <sup>2</sup> of Mr Pole of the State [Ducarel] to the servant [me[ for twelve years. When the respected lord departed, a dispute occurred between Ashraf Ali Khan and Khwajah Basit [a dispute occurred] according to the aforementioned claims <sup>3</sup> they seized that aforementioned area through the courts. That is why this servant [I], obtaining a comment and letter from Mister <span style='color:red'><u>illegible</u></span> in the name of the Rajah of Burdwan  on this matter, sent it, saying: as long as the  dispute between the two sides persists, whatever the right of the rent of Mirza Alim Beg which is set to be given to him is paid to the aforementioned Mirza.  Whatever the stated claims of the two sides are, they are different : under these circumstances, the servant [I] received the raised money in the year 1192 Bangla; [but] from the year 1193, the servant has not received one penny (kharmuhra) of the aforementioned amount. Now, Mr ‌Brook is here, if that lord [Ducarel], from his great mercy, could talk to Mister Sahib  about the raised amount. [In that case,] it is certain that with little effort the money will come into the hands of this servant [me]. [This] would be the very picture of lordship and guardianship. It was necessary that this be brought forward. Petition [of] Alim Beg, [sent] from a strange city. </p>",

Reza Khan had been restored to the post of Naib Nazim in 1780 and held it until his death in 1791. </p>\n<p> 5: House, mansion </p>\n<p> 6: Raja Devi Singh [dates], here transliterated with a ‘b’ rather than a ‘v’ sound as common in Bengal. [Insert reference to Maasir al Umara?] </p>\n<p> 7: A variation of بندهان बन्धान bandhān [S. बन्धन], s.m. raised embankments of earth for flooding lands (Platts). The word denoted an embankment or dam across a stream (Judicial Terms, 10). The area around the tomb is very near this type of embankment protecting the land from the flow of the river. </p>\n<p> 8: Bandobast, generally used to mean ‘arrangements’ but in the context of land revenue signified  'settlement of revenue from zamindar to government, or tenant to zamindar'. Judicial Terms, 10 </p>\n<p> 9: The word literally refers to a cowrie shell, the smallest unit of money in Bengal during the Sultanate period, but by late Mughal times simply denoting a very small amount of money represented by a token. </p>\n<p> 10:  Literally a ‘great man’ (Sanskrit maha+jan) and sometimes used in other parts of India to refer to a village elder but in Bengal in this period denotes a money-lender. Vernacular Judicial and Revenue Terms, 66. </p>",

And whenever this 'ulfaaq navisheen bank' [this seems to be a particular kind of bank note or letter] is sent to Calcutta, let that be an act of charity that is done, and then the letter will be sent to those sirs for this slave. Whatever is appropriate and suited to the time for this slave, that will be sent.<sup>4</sup> And in the name of this slave, a separate letter of recommendation should be sent so that my head shall be held high. And whenever some man [of yours] should come to Calcutta, please tell him whatever you find appropriate about me so that the aforementioned man may be welcomed by me in Calcutta and he might present a letter in the name of the sirs of the company to this bound one.</p>\n<p>Whatever the settlement for rent and taxes of parganah<sup>5</sup> Srīpūr and the parganah Surjyāpūr<sup>6</sup> belonging to Purneah <i>that</i> settlement for rent and taxes should be established in the name of this slave, for the sake of all us. This is the character (the sign and signal?) of the lords. Letters should be sent in my name by yourself to the Maharajah Dehraaj, the Raja Nimchad Bahadur and the Rajah of Burdwan [could this be Tej Chandra?], that whatever Mirza Alim Beg requests he should be given.</p>\n<p>Please cut off that spy and person who is paying attention, and hand over the reins to Mr. Grand (or Mr. Grant?) and whatever introduction you think appropriate to make, please put that down in writing. </p>\n<p>When [the lord, Gerard Gustavus] arrived back in his home country (England) he gave a note for 1200 rupees in the name of the Maharaja <b>Nimchad/Tej Chand</b> Bahadur and the <i>divan</i> (munshi) Nand Kumar<sup>7</sup> and treasurer (?) in order to complete the giving of the jagir or rights to revenue (to me).

The term <i>bandah</i> or 'bound one/slave' is an epithet to indicate that the speaker is humble, rather than actual slave status.\n4: [use of future as a request].\n5: A parganah is a unit of land, the name dating from the time of the Mughals. These names 'Sarpur' and 'Shore-jaa-pur' sound odd to me and I have not been able to find those names in any records. The translation of this sentence is provisional.\n6: Notes with references to the names of each of these parganahs is found in: L.S.S. O’Malley, <i>Bengal District Gazetteers: Purnea Gazetteer</i>. 1911, pp. 145-6.\n7: This letter must have been written before 1775, because Nandkumar was killed in 1775 (if this is the Maharaja Nandkumar).",

John Bogle was also working at the same time. Samuel Shelley was involved in the founding of the Watercolor Society, which may be able to provide some guidance about the provenance of this painting and some clarity about its being a signature painting of Shelley’s. The following page shows a list of paintings by Shelley previously auctioned off: http://www.artnet.com/artists/samuel-shelley/past-auction-results. Similarities in features such as the nose and eyes between this painting of Sharaf un-Nisa and Shelley's works indicate a strong chance this was one of his works. Note that the case in which it has come was not original but has been added to increase the protection to the painting. The matron cap and high collar of the dress she's wearing suggest adherence to societal norms of female modesty. Pearls have been farmed for centuries in Great Britain from freshwater mussels; however, today the practice is virtually banned across the nation. During the 18th century many regions experienced shortages in pearls, allowing only the wealthy to obtain real pearls.",

The practice of painting miniatures on ivory appeared in the early 1700s; however, due to the difficulty painting with water colors on ivory, the paintings tended to be small. A number of portrait artists moved to India with the permission of the East India Company and painted both British men and natives. There's no indication though that Paillou himself moved to India, so it's likely this was painted in London or nearby.",

    "additional_info": "Atr, or a Persian term for perfume, starting in the 17th century primarily refers to perfume made from the essential oil of roses. An essential oil captures the 'essence' of a plant's fragrance and typically captured via distillation. The production of rose oil originated in Persia, and the oil is priced high due to its intensive production and low output. The process of distilling and extracting oils from flowers began with the Persian Muslim scholar Ibn Sina, and this process later spread to Europe where the first real perfumes were manufactured. Perfume became widely used during Elizabeth I's reign, during which she required public places to be sprayed with perfume to remove foul odors. However, it still remained more prevalent in the aristocracy or upper classes, and was a necessary accessory for upper class women. Whereas many bottles at the time were created in Chinoiserie style, it appears this was created via enameling. Its small size suggests it would have been designed to be carried in a handbag or even on a chain, for easy access to perfume whenever necessary.",

    "additional_info": "The penmanship book was sold by a Shirley Woolmer, who also served as printer for the Exeter Gazette or one of the main newspapers in Devonshire. The inside cover features useful measurements and calculations that may be necessary for both everyday and obscure purposes, including a multiplication table and the Troy weight system used primarily for precious metal measurements. Sections of the book are dated out of order, indicating she went back possibly due to lack of paper as it was quite expensive. The paper is likely made of cotton and linen rags, both common materials in the 18th century for papermaking. Although the relatively high number of papermills in England (430 by 1800), the process of making paper was still done by hand at this point, which led to steep prices and its relative luxury status. By the late eighteenth century, writing was still a skill more reserved for the upper classes yet was important for the social education of gentlemen. The eighteenth century was marked by an increase in women learning the skill for household duties and a matter of formality, often learning through private tutors or relatives. Sharaf un-Nisa likely was taught by either or both a writing instructor and her children. This is also likely considering the frequently different handwriting used in the first line of many pages. Cursive was the standard writing practice at the time so Sharaf un-Nisa would have been taught to write cursive only. There are multiple mentions of people both within her life and general English society. She early writes her daughter’s name Harriet out several times, as well as using her married surname. There’s a reference to a 'Lady Glyn' who’s the 'Duchess of Puddle Dock.' Puddle Dock is a neighborhood in London and one of the poorer regions of the city during the 18th century. Glyn is the surname of an up-and-coming banking family and later influential descendants in the 1800s. This could possibly be referring to the wife of one of these bankers, or a quip at the differences between the family’s apparent wealth and the poverty found in this slum. She also names King George III, the reigning monarch at her time. There’s also mention by name of a Christopher Mason, who served as Rear Admiral of the White for the English. He may have been a household name, or possibly she had known him personally. There’s mention of a name Owen Cadwallader followed by the name of a ship from 1794, the Prince of Wales. He may have been a captain or another important crew member on board. There’s also a Cadwallader Owen who lived in the 16th and 17th centuries that played an important role as clergyman in Great Britain. The names Mrs Biddele and Monsieur Dupuy l’Algebria, who may be close associates of hers. There are also a few geographic locations, including several in Italy (Verona, Venice, and Placentia), Westminster Abbey, and several continents. The repetition of sayings and phrases on each page signifies these as common phrases of the day or maybe taken from a writing teaching guide.",
