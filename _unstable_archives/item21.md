  21 A: Envelope addressed to Mr. Ducarel in Exmouth, Devonshire. Mix of Persian and English script. The seal is that of ‘Alim Beg

  21 B: A massive letter! The paper has chain lines but is not burnished or flecked at all. The letter is written by Sharaf un-Nissa’s brother ‘Alim Beg and mentions another brother, Daim Beg. The letter spells out in very dire terms the financial straits of the family and makes clear that the family has holdings in Purnea, as well as links across the region. It also mentions John Shore. Note that the paper is not burnished AT ALL, perhaps a signifier of the urgency of the family’s financial straits.
