summary: Sharaf un-Nisa's pearl made of carnelian and gold; also included is a sample
  stamping of both seals
contents: 'It is a dark orange carnelian seal fob or pendant that has the following
  inscription: ''Ba ul-Lutf Mustafa (14)'' (By the kindness of Mustafa [meaning Muhammad]
  14 [meaning 1214, which would be 1799]. The metal of the gold is delicate, and it
  is possible there is a makerâ€™s mark on the loop where a chain would be threaded.
  This seems to be a remarkable combination of a Persian East India Company Seal with
  the ''fob/pendant'' trend of the 18th and 19th centuries in England. If the dating
  is as I interpret, then this means that the seal could have belonged to either Gerard
  Gustavus or Elizabeth.'

  Both sard and carnelian had been used  for Persian seals because the stone does
  not stick to hot wax. These were generally regarded as talismans, or objects regarded
  to have magical powers. During the Regency era, most sealing wax, typically colored
  red or black for the public, did not include any wax, instead incorporating ingredients
  such as powdered chalk or gypsum and vermilion. Long, thick sticks of sealing wax
  would be placed above a fire to be pressed down by a seal such as this one. Whereas
  many other seals featured a family crest, this stamp included a reference to Mustafa,
  an alternate name of the prophet Muhammad meaning chosen. It uses the Nasta''liq
  script, an elegant form of Persian calligraphy, to print the saying. The inscription
  includes 14 to mean the Hijri year 1214, or late 1799 in the Gregorian calendar,
  using the standard Islamic calendar.'
