summary: Sharaf un-Nisa's cusion cover may be made of silk and with colored thread
  that is in sections gold and silver. She may have made this herself.
contents: A cushion cover that is made of cloth of two contrasting colors; the inner
  panels are a rich red, and the outer panels are light green/blue. The red panel
  has floral motifs, and the bluish panel has an undetermined pattern, maybe depicting
  fire or symbolizing a bird such as a peacock. The thread used to weave the patterns
  seems to be gold and/or silver thread.

additional_info: 'The woven cover appears to have been manufactured with consideration
  of how much silk was used, based on the lack of excess threads. The blue/gray section
  may have possibly been a form of mashru, or a mixture of silk and cotton, noting
  its noticeable roughness and relative dullness. Based on the similarities of other
  textiles, it likely stems from the region near Patna, or the area now known as Bihar
  in India. The red cloth features a small, single-stemmed flower that is commonly
  depicted in seventeenth-century Mughal and Persian silk textiles. It''s unclear
  exactly what the pattern on the blue/gray section exactly is, but it may be a rendition
  of a bird such as a peacock.

notes_digitizer: Unfold and take a picture of the outside cloth. Also photograph inside
  of the cloth as much as possible without adding stress to fabric (to capture sewing
  irregularities). Make sure to capture the hand-sewn between cloth located at the
  inside of the cusion cover, which is also hand-sewn.
