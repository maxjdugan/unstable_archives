additional_info: Elizabeth is the name of Elizabeth Ducarel's daughter, whom she had
  with her first husband, Archibald Hamilton Foulkes. After his death in 1795, Elizabeth
  Ducarel eventually married Pierre Marie Fran√ßois de la Pasture, the Comte de la
  Pasture, referred to in this letter as the C de P. The Comte was a French noble
  who immigrated to Britain due to the French Revolution, one of the reasons why G.G.
  Ducarel originally opposed their union. The Bob Sutton referenced in this letter
  may be Robert William Evelyn Sutton, a relative.
