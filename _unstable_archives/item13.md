summary: 'A miniature painting of Gerard Gustavus Ducarel, made of guoache or watercolor
  on ivory disk, enclosed in a gold or brass frame. '
contents: The oval painting is a portrait of Gerard Gustavus Ducarel in a dark green
  coat and a white wig against a blue background. The portrait is signed 'P. Paillou
  1793.' The painting is framed in a brass or gold frame and covered with glass. The
  border is composed of ivory or bone, a braid of gold, surrounded by another thin
  frame of ivory. There is a brass loop on the top, positioned to suggest that it
  was meant to be worn as a necklace. On the back of the painting is a woven mat of
  hair.

additional_info: 'Peter Paillou was a well-known miniature painting artist including
  the following works: https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp87720/peter-paillou?search=sas&sText=peter+paillou.
  His father was also a well known artist/illustrator, so it''s likely he learned
  the craft from him. Most miniatures artists at the time were not trained professionally.
  The practice of painting miniatures on ivory appeared in the early 1700s; however,
  due to the difficulty painting with water colors on ivory, the paintings tended
  to be small. A number of portrait artists moved to India with the permission of
  the East India Company and painted both British men and natives. There''s no indication
  though that Paillou himself moved to India, so it''s likely this was painted in
  London or nearby.'
