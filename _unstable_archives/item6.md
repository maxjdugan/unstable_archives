additional_info: During the Georgian era, gold alloys in jewelry usually were 18 karats
  or more, so an alloy of copper and zinc first created by Christopher Pinchback that
  closely resembled gold allowed the general public to wear more jewelry without purchasing
  more expensive gold items. Iron and cut steel were also especially popular during
  this period. The advent of the rolling mill, or a machine which passes through metal
  stock to create uniform thickness and structure, in the mid 18th century made the
  production of gold and silver jewelry more streamlined. As were most Georgian and
  Regency-era jewelry, this pendant has a closed back to foil or place a thin sheet
  of metal behind the gems to reflect more light. Carnelian and ruby are two reddish
  types of gemstones commonly featured in daytime jewelry and share similar physical
  characteristics.
