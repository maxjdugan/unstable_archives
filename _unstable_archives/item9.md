additional_info: 'Ivory can be produced from the teeth and tusks of any sufficient
  mammal, but more commonly in the 18th century were harvested from elephants in Africa
  and Asia. The following link provides an example of an ivory disk featuring a rosette
  from the Mediterranean region during the Late Bronze Age: https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/244092.
  The material is relatively soft and easy to carve designs into, such as this floral
  bud pattern. The use of ivory dates back millennia across many cultures, including
  Islamic and Indian societies. Many artifacts from the Muslim world have been made
  with ivory, as traders had reliable access to the material from India and Africa.
  The flower on the disk appears to follow the standard of aniconism, or the lack
  of depictions of sentient figures on pieces of Islamic or related art, and follows
  a more abstract depiction resembling a flower. This item could possibly be a thread
  winder, which is a small, flat object on which thread can be wound. Often these
  were made of ivory and were necessary when threading at home.'
notes_digitizer: Photograph both the top and bottom of disk.
