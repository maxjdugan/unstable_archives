summary: Sharaf un-Nisa's perfume bottle made of mother of pearl and silver
contents: Perfume or ‘Atr holder with urn-shaped body composed of mother of pearl
  and silver, with what looks like a hand-made chain and stopper also made of silver.
  While the perfume holder does not stand up easily, it has a small round foot .5
  inches in diameter with a distinctive four-petalled floral imprint that could be
  a maker’s mark. Welding the two halves of mother of pearl together is a ridge of
  what looks like a braided pattern with regular finial shapes, each marked with their
  own finial mark. The design looks like some rosewater sprinklers.

additional_info: Atr, or a Persian term for perfume, starting in the 17th century
  primarily refers to perfume made from the essential oil of roses. An essential oil
  captures the 'essence' of a plant's fragrance and typically captured via distillation.
  The production of rose oil originated in Persia, and the oil is priced high due
  to its intensive production and low output. The process of distilling and extracting
  oils from flowers began with the Persian Muslim scholar Ibn Sina, and this process
  later spread to Europe where the first real perfumes were manufactured. Perfume
  became widely used during Elizabeth I's reign, during which she required public
  places to be sprayed with perfume to remove foul odors. However, it still remained
  more prevalent in the aristocracy or upper classes, and was a necessary accessory
  for upper class women. Whereas many bottles at the time were created in Chinoiserie
  style, it appears this was created via enameling. Its small size suggests it would
  have been designed to be carried in a handbag or even on a chain, for easy access
  to perfume whenever necessary.
