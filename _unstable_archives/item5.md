summary: Sharaf un-Nisa's perfume bottle case made of snakeskin and velvet
contents: 'This black snakeskin perfume bottle case has hinges and two delicate clasps.
  It is lined in green velvet. From scuffing on the bottom, it looks as if the perfume
  bottle and case were stored standing up on the small ''foot'' of the bottle/case.
  The green velvet lining is sewn rather than glued in, and the hinges are embedded
  underneath the snakeskin. '

additional_info: Velvet historically has been expensive due to the special loom required
  and use of fibers such as silk to create its distinguishing soft texture or feel.
  It originated in the Muslim world, specifically in Baghdad around 800 and became
  a favorite of nobility. It spread to Europe through Venetian traders, and made its
  way to England with King Richard II requesting to be buried in velvet. Snakeskin
  is an example of a luxury leather that features a scaly pattern unique to reptiles.
