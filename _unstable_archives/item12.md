additional_info: Geometric designs are common in many forms of Islamic art. The box
  clasp mechanism is a common sort of jewelry clasp which has a little tab that fits
  into a box-shaped frame and covered by a clasp. The snake chain gets its name because
  its closely linked rings appear to be smooth and in close appearance to a snake.
notes_digitizer: Photograph the chain.
