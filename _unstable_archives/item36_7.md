summary: Letter by G.G. Ducarel opposing the Comte de la Pasture's courtship of Ducarel's
  daughter Elizabeth. Ducarel states his reasons are because of the Comte's status
  as a noble emigrant from Revolutionary France, the fortunes of both parties, the
  Comte's religion, and the custody of Elizabeth's child with her first husband, Archibald
  Foulkes. The Foulkes family strongly disliked Elizabeth.
