  14A) This is an official request for the owner of owning the ability to collect taxation revenues in the parganah Shaahpur, which according to the letter had a revenue that was set at 39,000 rupees in 1799. This letter, at least judging from the seal, was written in 1779. The envelope addresses Ducarel as 'Khudaavand-i na’amat, Khutb-ud-daulah,' which means 'God of bounty, pole of governance' and was sent from Azimabad or modern-day Patnah. The letter, judging from the seal, was written by a man named Khwaram Tara Panah or Khourum Utar Panah. [Note, not written by any of Sharaf un-Nisa’s family as far as I can tell; this looks like a business letter intended only for Gerard Gustavus]

  14B) This letter is the same as the previous letter, but regarding a different parganah named Ghanapur (name uncertain).
