summary: Sharaf un-Nisa's ivory disk with floral bud pattern

  but closer look is a floral bud pattern, surrounded by several concentric circles
  and bordered by a final circle composed of several holes bored into the ivory. The
  back is plain. The owner has said that these are part of a sewing kit and that they
  were somehow attached to a type of cushion.They might be attachments to pincushions.
