  Cannetille style jewelry features fine wire or sheets of gold and silver twisted
  to intricate designs that display jewels such as amethysts and turquoise. Amethysts
  have a specific role in the Anglican church as bishops often wear ecclesiastical
  rings with the stone on it. In Anglo-Saxon and medieval European tradition, these
  stones were said to have healing and protective powers, and until the 18th century,
  it formed part of the cardinal, or most precious, gemstones. Turquoise was one if
  not the most prominent stones used in Persia for centuries for decorative purposes,
  being brought to India during the reign of the Mughal Empire where it was featured
  in gold jewelry and often attached with Arabic script.'
