contents: 'This letter may belong with the envelope labelled under ''Letter #2'' since
  it is signed Khurram Ali Khan, which seems to match the seal on #2. The letter also
  fits very neatly into that envelope listed as ''Letter # 2'' described as part of
  item 15 of this list. The letter is a burnished and gold flaked letter from Khurram
  Ali Khan written to request funding to give employment or funding to Mirza Daim
  Beg, one of Sharaf un-Nisaâ€™s brothers.'
