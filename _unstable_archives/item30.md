  <h3>Translation</h3>
  <p>The Raja sir has given excuses and tricks in the giving of the money; in the end, the land of the Mansab-<i>holder</i><sup>1</sup> Haji Shah Bahram Sahib that I liked at Tabare/Tabārī<sup>2</sup> haveli being ready, I asked again the aforementioned Burdwan Raja for money and got trick-playing in response; so I had to leave off the idea of buying Tabare haveli entirely.</p>
  <p>The generous lord has given so much of honor and dignity to the extent that it has become clear to all the bound ones/slaves.<sup>3</sup>The evidence of the lord’s attention and kindness and charity to every slave is beyond the limit. And whenever this 'ulfaaq navisheen bank' [this seems to be a particular kind of bank note or letter] is sent to Calcutta, let that be an act of charity that is done, and then the letter will be sent to those sirs for this slave. Whatever is appropriate and suited to the time for this slave, that will be sent.<sup>4</sup> And in the name of this slave, a separate letter of recommendation should be sent so that my head shall be held high. And whenever some man [of yours] should come to Calcutta, please tell him whatever you find appropriate about me so that the aforementioned man may be welcomed by me in Calcutta and he might present a letter in the name of the sirs of the company to this bound one.</p>
  <p>Whatever the settlement for rent and taxes of parganah<sup>5</sup> Srīpūr and the parganah Surjyāpūr<sup>6</sup> belonging to Purneah <i>that</i> settlement for rent and taxes should be established in the name of this slave, for the sake of all us. This is the character (the sign and signal?) of the lords. Letters should be sent in my name by yourself to the Maharajah Dehraaj, the Raja Nimchad Bahadur and the Rajah of Burdwan [could this be Tej Chandra?], that whatever Mirza Alim Beg requests he should be given.</p>
  <p>Please cut off that spy and person who is paying attention, and hand over the reins to Mr. Grand (or Mr. Grant?) and whatever introduction you think appropriate to make, please put that down in writing. </p>
  <p>When [the lord, Gerard Gustavus] arrived back in his home country (England) he gave a note for 1200 rupees in the name of the Maharaja <b>Nimchad/Tej Chand</b> Bahadur and the <i>divan</i> (munshi) Nand Kumar<sup>7</sup> and treasurer (?) in order to complete the giving of the jagir or rights to revenue (to me). Here I took the letter (to do that thing) but then the Bengalis are so ill-natured and terrible at keeping promises that all of this was neglected (it went in one ear and out the other) and they did not respond at all. At the hands of the Bengalis I have become limitlessly powerless and I have become very desperate.</p>
  <h3>Notes</h3> 
  1: [a mansab holder is the owner].
  2: 'Tabare' seems to be the name of the haveli, a word that means 'estate' or 'mansion'
  3: It is unclear whether the Lord referred to is Gerard Gustavus, the recipient of the letter, or whether it is God himself being referred to here. The term <i>bandah</i> or 'bound one/slave' is an epithet to indicate that the speaker is humble, rather than actual slave status.
  4: [use of future as a request].
  5: A parganah is a unit of land, the name dating from the time of the Mughals. These names 'Sarpur' and 'Shore-jaa-pur' sound odd to me and I have not been able to find those names in any records. The translation of this sentence is provisional.
  6: Notes with references to the names of each of these parganahs is found in: L.S.S. O’Malley, <i>Bengal District Gazetteers: Purnea Gazetteer</i>. 1911, pp. 145-6.
  7: This letter must have been written before 1775, because Nandkumar was killed in 1775 (if this is the Maharaja Nandkumar).

summary:
contents: "Letter on unburnished paper in Persian. It is unclear who wrote the letter,
  but it seems apparent that it was one of the brothers, most likely Allum Beg because
  he is not listed in the very detailed sign-off at the end of the letter. This letter
  is useful because it lists everyone in Sharaf un-Nisa’s family. This letter also
  seems to start in midstream, as there is no formal greeting and the letter begins
  uncharacteristically right at the top of the page. \n"
